Reference scaffold for evaluating LLM agents on the **Big Finance** benchmark — 928
workflow-grounded financial-research questions, each paired with an expert-authored
rubric and a reference answer.

This harness reproduces the headline numbers from the companion paper,
[BigFinanceBench: A Workflow-Grounded Benchmark for Financial-Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.03829).
It is deliberately minimal: a ReAct loop, four publicly-replicable tools, and a
unified message format that runs the same scaffold across any model accessible
through [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).

## What's here

| | |
|---|---|
| `big_finance_harness/` | Python package: ReAct agent, tools, judge, types |
| `scripts/` | Orchestrator (eval + grade), analysis, plotting |
| `tests/` | Test suite (53 tests, no network deps) |
| `data/` | Public 50-item subset (`big_finance_subset.jsonl`) + datasheet |
| `grades/` | Public grading outputs from Gemini 3.1 Pro, Claude Opus 4.7, and GPT-5.5 |
| `human_workpapers/` | Two illustrative workbooks from independent human validation |

## Tools

The four tools given to the agent (plus a terminal `final_answer`):

| Tool | Backed by |
|---|---|
| `web_search` | SerpAPI (preferred) or Tavily (fallback) |
| `edgar_search` | SEC EDGAR public REST API |
| `fetch_url` | httpx + BeautifulSoup + BM25 (optional in-document retrieval) + PyMuPDF (PDFs) |
| `python_exec` | subprocess (5s timeout; not a security sandbox) |
| `final_answer` | terminator |

We deliberately exclude: vector-store retrieval, premium financial data sources
(FactSet, CapIQ, Bloomberg, etc.), broker research, and provider-specific affordances
(native web search, tool-search, deferred-loading, model grounding). Every model gets
the same surface so the evaluation measures the model, not the scaffold.

## Install

Requires Python ≥ 3.11.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .                 # tool package only
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[eval]"         # evaluation + grading harness
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[full]"         # evaluation, grading, and analysis
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[analysis]"     # add pandas + matplotlib only
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[eval,dev]"     # full test suite + ruff
```

The base install intentionally contains only the dependencies required to import and
run `big_finance_harness.tools`. Model/provider integrations (including LiteLLM and
Google Vertex packages) live in the `eval` extra so the tools can be embedded in
dependency-constrained agent environments such as NVIDIA NeMo/Gym without pulling in
an unrelated provider stack.

Set environment variables for the providers you intend to call (you only need keys
for the providers you use):

```bash
# Direct provider APIs:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Or via Google Vertex (uses Application Default Credentials):
export VERTEXAI_PROJECT=your-gcp-project
gcloud auth application-default login

# For open-frontier models via Vercel AI Gateway:
export VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...

# Web search (one of the two):
export SERP_API_KEY=...      # SerpAPI (preferred)
export TAVILY_API_KEY=...    # Tavily (fallback)

# SEC EDGAR requires a User-Agent on every request:
export SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT="Your Name your@email.com"
```

## Dataset

Each row is one item conforming to `DatasetItem` in `big_finance_harness/types.py`:

```json
{
  "id": "bf-4eb39b2c53",
  "query": "If I take Dayforce's management adjusted reported EBIT...",
  "reference_answer": "Overstated by $90.1m...",
  "rubric": [
    {"text": "Identifies DAY as ticker", "points": 1},
    {"text": "Identifies Fiscal Year Ended December 31 2024", "points": 2}
  ]
}
```

The publicly-released $50$-item subset is bundled in `data/big_finance_subset.jsonl`,
licensed CC BY 4.0, and mirrored on Hugging Face at
[`RogoAI/big-finance-benchmark`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RogoAI/big-finance-benchmark).
See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for schema and provenance, and
[`data/DATASHEET.md`](data/DATASHEET.md) for the full datasheet. The held-back
remainder of the benchmark is available on request through the maintainer; place
it at `data/big_finance_full.jsonl` to swap into the commands below.

## Quickstart

A small end-to-end run on five questions, one model, one judge:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_eval_set.py \
  --dataset data/big_finance_subset.jsonl \
  --run-id quickstart \
  --kind dry_run \
  --sample-n 5 \
  --judge openai:gpt-5.5
```

Output goes to `runs/quickstart/`:
- `manifest.json` — config, dataset hash, model list
- `<model_label>.traces.jsonl` — full ReAct trajectories
- `<model_label>.grades.jsonl` — judge verdicts per (question, rubric line)

For the headline run, see `scripts/run_eval_set.py --help` for all flags;
relevant ones: `--n-trials`, `--judge` (multiple), `--concurrency`,
`--grade-concurrency`, `--skip-model`, `--judge-alias`.

## Reproduce the paper's headline numbers

The paper's Table 1 was produced by:

```bash
# 1. Eval + grade across all default models with two judges
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_eval_set.py \
  --dataset data/big_finance_full.jsonl \
  --run-id headline \
  --kind headline \
  --n-trials 3 \
  --judge vertex:gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
  --judge vertex-anthropic:claude-opus-4-7

# 2. Backfill missing eval- and judge-side costs
.venv/bin/python scripts/recompute_costs.py --run-dir runs/headline

# 3. Build the long-form analysis CSVs and per-question metadata
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_analysis_csv.py \
  --run-dir runs/headline \
  --dataset data/big_finance_full.jsonl \
  --out-dir runs/headline/analysis

# 4. Headline accuracy table with bootstrap CIs and inter-judge kappa
.venv/bin/python scripts/headline_table.py \
  --per-grade-csv runs/headline/analysis/per_grade.csv \
  --out-dir runs/headline/analysis

# 5. Plots
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_plots.py \
  --analysis-dir runs/headline/analysis \
  --out-dir runs/headline/analysis/plots
```

## Methodology

- **Sampling**: provider defaults, with only the short scaffold system prompt shown above.
- **Step budget**: 50 turns by default (`--max-steps`).
- **Trials**: each (question, model) pair runs 3 times.
- **Judges**: default two-judge panel (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview + Claude Opus 4.7);
  per-rubric and final-answer scoring returned in one structured response. We report
  the two-judge mean and inter-judge Cohen's κ alongside accuracy. Both judges also
  appear in the evaluated lineup; averaging across two different model families is
  intended to limit any single-family self-preference, and the high inter-judge κ is
  the check on it. Released grades also include GPT-5.5 as an additional robustness
  judge.
- **Resumption**: keyed on `(question_id, trial_idx, judge)`; errored traces
  re-run, terminal states (`final_answer`, `max_steps`, `no_tool_call`,
  `context_exceeded`, `token_budget`) are treated as complete.
- **Snapshots**: model IDs without a date suffix emit a warning; the trace still
  captures the resolved snapshot returned by the provider via
  `RunRecord.resolved_model`. Dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Costs**: LiteLLM-reported `cost_usd` is authoritative when present.
  `recompute_costs.py` fills missing evaluation and judge costs from pinned rate
  tables. Verify the tables against current rates before publishing.
- **`python_exec` is not a sandbox.** It's a subprocess with a 5-second timeout
  and no filesystem, network, or syscall isolation. Users running untrusted
  prompts should run the harness inside a container with `--network=none
  --read-only` and a tightened seccomp profile.
